Vulcand
=======

Vulcand is a programmatic extendable proxy for microservices and API management.
It is inspired by [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and powers Mailgun microservices infrastructure.

Focus and priorities
--------------------
Vulcand is focused on microservices and API use-cases.

Features
--------

* Uses etcd as a configuration backend.
* API and command line tool.
* Pluggable middlewares.
* Support for canary deployments, realtime metrics and resilience.

Opentracing Support
------------
Vulcand has support for open tracing via the [Jaeger client
libraries](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go). Users who wish
to use tracing support should use the `--enableJaegerTracing` flag and must
either run the Jaeger client listening on `localhost:6831/udp` or set the
environment variables `JAEGER_AGENT_HOST` and `JAEGER_AGENT_POST`. (See the
[Jaeger client libraries](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go)
for all available configuration environment variables.)

When enabled vulcand will create 2 spans: one span called `vulcand` which
covers the entire downstream request and another span called `middleware` which
only spans the processing of the middleware before the request is routed
downstream.

Aliased Expressions
------------
When running vulcand in a kubernetes DaemonSet vulcand needs to know requests
from the local node can match `Host("localhost")` rules. This `--aliases` flag
allows an author of a vulcand DaemonSet to tell vulcand the name of the node it's
currently running on, such that vulcand correctly routes requests for
`Host("localhost")`. The `--aliases` flag allows the user to pass in multiple
aliases separated by commas.

Example
```
$ vulcand --aliases 'Host("localhost")=Host("192.168.1.1")'
```
